# Tokenix – Secure Digital Wallet for Blockchain Tokens

Tokenix is a FinTech & Cyber project that demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure digital wallet for creating, storing, and transferring blockchain tokens.
The project is built as a full-stack system combining a backend API, a client-side web interface, and blockchain smart contracts, with a strong emphasis on security, clean architecture, and test-driven development.

The system uses a single ERC-20 smart contract written in Solidity (OpenZeppelin) to mint and manage tokens. Users generate cryptographic key pairs locally, while the backend is responsible for authentication, transaction management, and interaction with the blockchain. All communication is secured using HTTPS/TLS, and sensitive data is encrypted at rest.

---

## Main Functional Requirements

* Create a new user account and generate a cryptographic key pair for signing and encryption.
* Display wallet token balances, including token identifiers.
* Transfer tokens between users with clear transaction states (Pending, Confirmed, Failed).
* Record all transactions in an auditable transaction log.
* Provide users with access to their transaction history.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

* Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all communication.
* Securely store passwords and sensitive data in a cloud database.
* Use containerization (Docker) to ensure environment parity and portability.
* Support horizontal scalability of services.
* Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) with unit and integration tests for all components.

| Layer          | Technologies                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend       | React (Vite), client-side key management                        |
| Backend        | Node.js / Express (API, authentication, blockchain interaction) |
| Smart Contract | Solidity (OpenZeppelin ERC-20)                                  |
| Database       | PostgreSQL or MongoDB                                           |
| DevOps         | Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)                  |

## Security and Threat Modeling

The project includes a STRIDE threat analysis covering:

* Spoofing
* Tampering
* Repudiation
* Information Disclosure
* Denial of Service
* Elevation of Privilege

Mitigations include strong authentication, digital signatures, encrypted communication, encrypted storage, audit logging, and traffic monitoring.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose installed
* Node.js (for running services without Docker)

---

## Running the Full Stack (Recommended)

From the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Once running:

* Backend API: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

  * Health check: [http://localhost:3000/health](http://localhost:3000/health)
* Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

---

## Running Services Locally (Without Docker)

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The backend listens on port 3000 and expects a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. When using Docker Compose, this is set automatically.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Smart Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
npx hardhat compile
```

To deploy locally:

```bash
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

---

## Design and Testing

The system design follows UML principles, including:

* Use Case Diagrams
* Sequence Diagrams
* Class Diagrams
* ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagrams)

All components are developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD), with tests written before implementation using appropriate frameworks (e.g., Jest).

## Team Responsibilities

### Ilana Estrin — Backend · System Architecture · Security

Leads backend architecture and core system design.  
Responsible for authentication and authorization (JWT, RBAC), database schema and data integrity, API contract governance, transaction lifecycle orchestration, and system-wide security enforcement.

### Shely Zino — Frontend · Client Layer · Wallet Experience

Leads the client application architecture and user interaction layer.  
Responsible for the React frontend, wallet experience design, client-side key management and digital signature flows, and full API integration including payload structure, status handling, and error management.

### Lior Zvieli — Blockchain · Smart Contract · On-Chain Integration

Leads the blockchain and smart contract domain.  
Responsible for the ERC-20 smart contract design and deployment, on-chain logic (minting, transfers, validation), Ethers.js integration layer, and blockchain-level testing and reliability.

---

## Work Plan / MVP

The Minimum Viable Product includes:

* A backend API with health-check and database connectivity.
* A React frontend confirming successful operation.
* A Solidity ERC-20 smart contract with deployment scripts.
* A Docker Compose setup for running all components together.

This foundation provides a secure and extensible base for future feature expansion.
